CARD 4: Architecture Reverse Engineering


1. Do you recognize these components?
2. Which of these components have you implemented?
3. Which of these components belong to the Android framework?
4. Is there any component that was crucial in the implementation, but this tool did not recover? 
5. Is there any component that was not recovered? 
6. Is it possible to identify any architectural style that was used (client server, publish subscribe) or any technology (Fiware, Firebase, Context Broker)?
