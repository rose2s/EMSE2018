### Reversed-Engineering Architecture

> **Steps**

    - Get the apk file
    - Use COVERT tool to generate the intermediate code (*file.xml*)
    - Add *file.xml* into *ACME-Generator* folder with *file.apk*
    - Execute the comand line to generate *file.acme*
    - Open *file.acme* in ACME STUDIO
    
##### APk & COVERT

```sh
$ java -jar apktool.jar d K-9\ Mail_5.207_apk-dl.com.apk -f
```

| Apk converter | Site |

- Add o file *example.apk* em Covert folder
- Comando: ```sh $ ./covert.sh folder ```
- Output: *example.xml* (locaded in folder/analysis/model/example.xml)

##### ACME-Generator
- Add a sa√≠da do covert na pasta ACME-Generator-master
- Comando: ```sh run.py ./apps/example.apk ./resources    ```
- Output: *example.acme*

##### ACME STUDIO
- Create a new project
- Add file *example.acme* in ACME workspace
- Refresh project

### Theory

#### Constructs of the theory
 
|  | |  |
| :------: | :------ | :------ |
| **C1** | *Architecture design* | A high-level structural design of a software system.
| **C2** | *Architectural styles* | A set of design decisions that identify the kinds of components and connectors that may be used to compose a system or subsystem. |
| **C3** | *Design Decisions* | A description of the set of architectural additions,  subtractions and modifications to the software architecture, the rationales, design rules, and design constraints and additional requirements that (partially) realize one or more requirements on a given architecture.
| **C4** | *Technical debt* | A concept in SE that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. 
| **C5** | *Smart city context* | Mobile apps about city innovation in management and policy as well as technology. 
| **C6**| *Domain experts* | A person with special knowledge in the context in the domain of smart cities (e.g., a firefighter is an expert in an emergency management app).
| **C7** | *Technical skills* | Abilities needed for software programming.
| **C8** | *Documentation* | Artifacts about the software (e.g., requirement specification).
| **C9** | *Functional requirements* | A requirement that defines what a system is supposed to do.
| **C10** | *Non-functional requirements* | A requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
| **C11** | *Technologies* | Technical tools that support the software development.
| **C12** | *API* | A software intermediary that allows apps to talk to each other.
| **C13** | *Framework* | It is a coherent unit of reuse, both by use-relationships and by extension through sub-classing.
| **C14** | *Software development* | The process of specifying, designing, developing, and testing involved in mobile applications. 
| **C15** | *Challenges* |Challenges faced when designing and developing a SCMA. 
| **C16** | *Development Approach* | There are three primary approaches to building mobile apps: web, hybrid and native.
| **C17** | *Resources management* |The effective use of mobile resources.
| **C18** | *Software Testing* |An investigation conducted to provide information about the \quality of the software product.
| **C19** | *Testing Tools* | Software intended to help software engineers to find bugs in mobile apps.
| **C20** | *Testing Issues* | Issues related to testing mobile software (e.g., testing real scenarios).
| **C21** | *User Training* | Process of training a staff who will work supporting the citizen through the app. 
#### Propositions of the theory


|  | | 
 :------------: | :----------- |
**P1** | Domain experts positively impact the definition of requirements for a SCMA.
**P2** | The lack of documentation creates technical debt.
**P3** | Functional requirements for a SCMA come from a smart cities context, which is citizen-oriented.
**P4** | Most non-functional requirements are not taken into consideration by the SE team when making design decisions.
**P5** | The satisfaction of non-functional requirements depends upon the design decisions made.
**P6** | The level of technical skills impact the development of SCMA.
**P7** | Lack of architecture decision-making  creates technical debt.
**P8** | The architecture design of SCMA is API-centric.
**P9** | The use of architectural styles positively impacts the design of SCMA.
**P10** | Effective mobile resource management positively impacts the architecture design of SCMA.
**P11** | The smart cities context brings complexity to mobile applications.
**P12** |The development or adoption of smart city frameworks reduces the complexity of the development of SCMA.
**P13** | The level of development challenges in SCMA depends upon the development approach adopted.
**P14** | Smart technologies positively impact the development speed of SCMA.
**P15** | The lack of testing tools for mobile applications negatively impacts the testing of SCMA.
**P16** | Training users positively impacts the product acceptance of SCMA.
**P17** | Testing SCMA involves the need to simulate real-world scenarios.
